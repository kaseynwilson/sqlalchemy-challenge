### For an upcoming vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii, we are analyzing climate patterns to determine the best time to plan our trip. 

### As part of the Analysis, the following steps were completed:
* Query the most recent 12 months of precipitation data from hawaii.sqlite file.
* Plotted the precipitation data points in chronological order using the DataFrame plot method. 
* Gathered summary statistics for the precipitation data. 
* Identified the unique weather stations in the dataset and determined the most active station. 
* For the most active station a query was performed for the last 12 months of temperature oversrvations. 
* Plotted the results as a histogram. 
* Designed a Flask API based on these queries performed.
